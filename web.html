      <h2>No Friends On Powder Days</h2>
      <p>
      " No doubt, when it comes to seasons I have my clear visions of where I wanna be. I mean many people have probably their preferences at a certain age, as a pure <strong>Austrian Girl</strong> I spent most of my life in the mountains. There is nothing better I can tell you all then being surrounded by a panorama like Schladming, or even Innsbruck. Innsbruck has his juwel of the alps and it definitely has every right to own this name! Austria is just great and gave me so much I will be always thankful for. Humbled is for sure bold and in capital letters written where I come from. It gave me this close relationship to the nature, what made me to this passionated sport enthusiast what I am now. Thank u so much for forming my personality. "

      <h2>Cali Guuurl</h2>
      <p>
      " However, another thing I realised after a while was that, even tho u live at a specific place doesn't mean u stuck there. Take your shit and find out what the world offers. Especially for me the summer was important. I love hiking, but also the sea. I mean the ocean is just massive impressive. So pretty and terrifying at the same time. So I decided to live for a while abroad in San Francisco and I expected a lot but not the fact that I don't wanna go back home. <strong>HAHA</strong>! So here I am, soon almost two years. Close to mountains and right in front of the sea. Austria meets Cali and let me tell u one thing, if u think u can't be infected of the vibe of Cali then let's talk again when u lived here for a while. Most of my friends still won't accept the fact that I fell so much in <strong>LOVE</strong> with America - but well fuck I did. Indeed this place won't get rid of me so soon, I'll promise! "
